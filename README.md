Nuchat

Nuchat is a from-scratch (and worse!) alternative to other chat applications.  Eventually I'd like it not to suck as much, but only time will tell.


INSTALLATION

git clone https://www.github.com/notoriouslogank/nuchat.git

To launch a server, navigate into the nuchat directory and run

python3 nuchat.py

There's a standalone client in the client directory; by default, it
will attempt to use the IP and Port number of the server created last
time it was run -- thus, you'll need to edit client.py to reflect
the IP and Port you want to connect to.
